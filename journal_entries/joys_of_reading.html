        I was recently asked what was one good thing that came from the covid
        experience that positively impacted my life. The first thought that came
        to my mind was work from home. I mean c'mon, who isn't a fan of WFH? But
        giving it a little more thought, the best thing that came from covid for
        me was the joy of reading I discovered. One day as I was cleaning my
        room I found this book "A long way gone" by Ishmael Beah (fantastic
        read by the way) given to me by my parents years ago. As I picked up the book, a thought came to my mind
        that the last time I read a novel was literally grade 12 english. I
        debated for a while if I was actually going to <em>read</em>, but I'm so
        glad I did. The things I've gained these past 4 years from books have
        been invaluable not just in learning new things, but becoming a better
        public speaker and learning to be more empathetic to those around me.

      <p class="mt-3">My favourite books I have read:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pachinko - Min Jin Lee</li>
        <li>A fine balance - Rohinton Mistry</li>
        <li>Brothers - Yu Hua</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        These 3 books are very sad. They all tell the stories of underprivileged
        characters from poor Asian countries who face wave after wave of
        struggles. But yet they keep moving forward. I hope as I look back on
        this journal entry years from now, I have added new books to this list
        and shared these novels with others.
