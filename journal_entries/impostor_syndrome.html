      <h1 class="mt-5 fs-1">Impostor syndrome and feeling not good enough</h1>
      <h2 class="mb-5 fs-5">(April 1, 2024)</h2>
      <p class="mt-3">
        I recently moved to a new project at work which I'll be helping to lead
        after spending the past 2 years on the same project. The impostor
        syndrome is real. I suppose it's the unfamiliarity that frightens me,
        along with the added expectations of being the go-to dev people will ask
        questions to. I feel there are numerous things that I still don't know
        and cannot answer — I'm worried people will notice my lack of knowledge
        and doubt my abilities to lead this new project. I was called the
        'expert' of my previous project, primarily because I was the
        longest-standing member and in truth, not because I was the dev who knew
        this app inside and out. I didn't work on many parts of the app
        (especially the hard features), which, as it turns out, are the most
        crucial on this new project. Maybe that was my fault? I should have
        taken more initiative to try and learn but I was afraid to reveal to my
        managers or team that I couldn't handle them. I just kept digging a
        deeper and deeper hole the longer I waited. I was comfortable on what I
        knew and I wanted to keep working on familiar things.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        One thing that helps me through this is thinking back to all the other
        previous times I've experienced impostor syndrome. At my old job when I
        had to work on tickets above my domain of knowledge, the days leading up
        to starting a new job or being tasked with fixing a production issue
        which many teams are relying on etc. When you're in that moment, the
        doubts start creeping into your mind. "There's no way I can handle
        this”. "I'm about to get fired if I can't deliver this". "They made a
        mistake trusting in me". But to be honest, looking back at it now, I
        can't remember the specificity of these events nor the reaction of
        others once the task was completed. When I was going through impostor
        syndrome, it felt like such a heavy weight on my chest and the most
        critical thing in my life. But as time passes and I look back at it a
        few years later, it feels so insignificant and such a small bump in
        terms of my career. Our imagination is often much more severe than
        reality. I guess how I am learning to deal with impostor syndrome is to let
        time do its thing. Work hard as you are going through it and try your
        best to deliver results. You have been given this task/responsibility/job because others trust that you can do it. Communicate with your team and ask others for
        help. <u>You are capable.</u>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        I don't want to downplay impostor syndrome, because as you're going
        through it, it does feel like a mountain you can't see over. But time
        will pass and you will learn. You have been through this multiple times
        before and you've made it this far into your career.
