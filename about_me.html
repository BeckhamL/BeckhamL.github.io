    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Beckham Lam and I am currently a junior at McGill University studying Software Engineering and Economics. During my time at McGill, I have developed a fond passion for both finance and technology and even more so when the two disciplines are intertwined. During my free time, I enjoy learning to program especially in the area of Android development. During the summer of 2016, I developed, designed and deployed my own Android app on the Google Play store called 'Alphabeti' where the main objective is to teach users general and fun facts about geography. </p>
    <br>


    <p> Apart from school, I enjoy many activities ranging from skateboarding to swimming but my upmost joy comes from video games. As long as I can remember, ever since I was a kid I fell in love with the idea of being able to talk and interact with friends and people from all over the world and seemingly make time disappear. I'll never forget the day when I was playing Call of Duty on Xbox Live and I hear a familiar voice. It turns out to be my friend whom I haven't spoken to in 3 years since moving schools and instantly were able to join lobbies and have the best and most addicting 2 years of our lives killing zombies together. Who would've thought that video games weren't all that bad after all? </p>
    <br>

    <p> Fast forward 10 years and my love for technology and connecting people together still have not diminished. If you'd like to talk or learn more about me, feel free to add me on LinkedIn or contact me at beckham.lam@mail.mcgill.ca </p>
